AnyVar
!!!!!!

AnyVar enables **registration**, **lookup**, and **search** of genetic variants across a distributed genomic resource network. Its goals are to:

* Provide an open source, off-the-shelf solution that lowers the technical barriers for genomic data resources to comprehensively describe and search genomic variants
* Support a broad range of query modes, including VRS ID lookups, HGVS expressions, gene-based searches, and genomic ranges
* Translate community nomenclatures and conventions into a universal model for variant representation
* Provide a community-driven, extensible platform for shared conventions and policy to realize the above goals
