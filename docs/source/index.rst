AnyVar
==================================

**AnyVar** provides Python and REST interfaces to validate, normalize, generate identifiers, and register biological sequence variation according to the GA4GH Variation Representation standards. Given a supported variation description (e.g. a single nucleotide variation described in HGVS nomenclature), AnyVar will normalize it, store its constituent parts, and return digest keys for later retrieval.
